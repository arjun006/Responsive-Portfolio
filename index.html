        <p>
                I've always enjoyed being creative and adventureous, before I made the decision to try my hand
            at web development, I would spend my time sketching or trying to find new places and exciting
            ways to photograph and capture a scene or moment and share it on social media.
        </p>

                Web development gives me a new medium to showcase my creativity, and a new challenge in trying to
            express an emotion, mood or theme through the design of a webpages and applications.  I am especially
            drawn to the freedom and mobility of web development, the ability to work and be productive
            almost anywhere in the world and not be confined to a workspace is a luxury most others careers  
            don't have.
